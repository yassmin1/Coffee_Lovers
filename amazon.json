Lavazza coffee beans/roasts are quality you can taste, and have distinguishable flavor profiles from one roast to the next. If you enjoy espressos and/or black drip coffee, this is where the untainted distinguishable flavors really come through. So far, I have tried and enjoyed their Gran Crema, Gold Selection, and Super Crema, and each one has its own unique flavor profile.After using Lavazza espresso beans for months in my Super Automatic Espresso Machine, I decided to finally use a use a Starbucks gift card I had lying around to purchase a bag of Starbucks espresso roast beans. It was then I realized how bitter and the lack of flavor character their beans have. I have nothing against Starbucks whatsoever, other than their bitter bland coffee roasts. \ud83d\ude09 I have noticed over the years Starbucks\u2019 coffee has become more and more bitter with less and less distinguishable flavor characteristics along the way, and the only noticeable difference between their roasts is the bitterness level. Years ago, I had always enjoyed their Italian roast, Gold Coast, and Verona, among others, but over time I noticed they became more and more bitter, and less and less distinguishable between each roast. Is this because Starbucks is over roasting their beans to mask the lower quality of beans? Are they forced to use lower quality beans because of the volume of beans they must procure to supply their global presence? I would take an educated guess and say, \u201cYes\u201d.In my opinion, society has become so habitually transfixed with Starbucks, most people don\u2019t know what real/good coffee is anymore, and I'll explain why. Most of the coffee drinks they sell are flavored with various sweeteners, flavors, milk(s), and/or whip creams, etc., so their bitter characterless coffee is masked by all those additives. I mostly drink black drip coffee to enjoy the full raw flavor and characteristics of the coffee beans/blend/roast, which is how good quality beans and roasts are distinguished, but Espresso and black drip coffee drinkers are in the minority. So maybe that is the calculated decision Starbucks had to make.So, the bottom line is, if you want to enjoy good quality coffee/espresso beans that aren\u2019t over roasted and bitter, and have tasty and distinguishable flavor profiles, then Lavazza is certainly a better/recommended option.Try and enjoy each one of their different and distinguishable roasts, and rediscover what truly good quality coffee tastes like. Cheers!"},

I usually buy Espresso Vivace, Doma, or Klatch, but I ran out, and ordered this to try it. I read the negative reviews about Amazon customers finding rocks in their Lavazza beans, so I was a little worried about it. But I thought it was probably pretty rare. Unfortunately, I found Rocks in my coffee too. Part way through the bag I heard the noise and I knew it was a rock. I've had my Mazzer Mini grinder for over a decade, and it's never made that noise before. I turned it off immediately and looked through the ground coffee for the rock. I found a rock about 7mm x 2mm (after it went through the grinder). See photo. There were probably more fragments in the coffee I tossed - before I thought of looking for them. So that made me curious about the rest of the beans. I placed part of the beans in a pot of water, so that the rocks would sink to the bottom. I found one rock and it was about 7mm x 7mm (about 1/4\"). If I found two rocks I am sure there were more. I only looked through a portion of the beans.My grinder burrs are probably damaged - not being designed to grind rocks. I plan to replace them now. The grinder burrs are $50 to $60. I'm researching it now to see if I can install those myself. This turned out to be the most expensive coffee that I ever purchased.I don't get it. I have been buying different Italian roast beans for 15 years and never once had rocks. Lavazza must know about it. They apparantly read the reviews. I don't understand why their quality department allows it, and why they don't fire the suppliers that provide them with these beans. Coffee beans with rocks are presumably less expensive, but there is a cost to losing customers. I will never purchase Lavazza again.Sorry. I meant to keep it short. I still can't believe it. Rocks. In my coffee. How did the coffee taste? Who cares?July 2018 Update: I posted photos of the rocks and the bag with Mfg codes. I sent the photos and MFG codes to Lavazza, as they had requested that when they made their comment.Aug 2018 Update: I was not allowed to reply to the comment from Lavazza, so I just wanted to add this... The MFD is 25/01/2018. The B.B. is 30/12-2019. The B.No is CA25AD. Lavazza never responded to my email that they requested. From reading their comment that we should buy beans directly from Lavazza, I can't tell if they are saying they sell a lower grade of beans to resellers, or that resellers may have counterfeit Lavazza beans."},

The espresso drinker who prefers a stronger taste and full body will also certainly enjoy this roast blend.Tastes: If everyone had the same tastes and liked the same things, there would only be one coffee in the world. Finding the \"perfect\" coffee is a personal decision tailored by your own taste and likes, and even then, many times you want to have something different or change, therefore in finding YOUR perfect coffee, it depends on your present tastes and moods at that one particular moment in time...which can change. My best advice is follow your feelings and have a try at different things to find NOT what you like, but what you DEFINITELY do not like. And most certainly do not buy or force yourself to like something, because others do like it or love it. Buy for you, not for them.Coffee basics: 2 types of beans. Arabica, which have a smoother taste in general but have lighter body and make less crema, and Robusto, which make more crema and have a stronger taste and body but carry more bitterness. Plants are grown in warmer climates all around the globe, and each place yields beans with distinct flavors regardless of the same bean used. The roasting of the coffee, different machines, water quality and grind quality also add to these differences. Tamping (espresso styles) and amount of coffee makes a very minimal difference compared to all the other factors, and everyone gets the hang of it with practice (i.e. no need to focus so much on pressures and exact weight and times). WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT: the WATER!, the quality of the coffee, the right grind for the style you are making (finer for espresso and Turkish, coarser for other styles), and a good machine for that style, which is NOT synonymous with expensive (stove tops are not). You get these 4 things right, and all the other factors won't matter much, and you will have an excellent coffee every time. The water here where I live is horrible, and so was my coffee, so I had to spend quite a lot on a filtration system for the water.Italian coffee: Our preferred styles are espresso, cappuccino, and latte (it really means milk and the original Italian name is caff\u00e8 e latte, but we have dropped the \"e\" over time) and all are served hot. In Italy, flavors/things added to these styles are only found in places where tourists are (i.e. no creams, cinnamon, iced, etc) and most Italians do not even consider or have heard of adding anything else, other than sugar. In Italian bars (this is what we call coffee shops in Italy and why they're called baristas) ALL coffee is a blend of arabica and robusta, making them versatile. ALL bars in Italy also use whole milk, typically what we call lunga conservazione which stores at room temperature until opened (hence less refrigeration storing space needed). You might find places that use more than just whole milk in tourist areas, but is not a certainty. Whole milk froths better than other milk. Coffee is quite important in Italy, so much that the price of coffee is strictly regulated and has been, long before the owners of Starbucks were even born.Lavazza: Most sold coffee brand in Italy. Lavazza makes 2 lines of coffee geared to the preferred Italian styles, one for home use, and one commercial, but each and every one of them is different from each other and any coffee in the home line is totally different from any one in the commercial line. The home line consists of:1. Qualit\u00e0 Oro - 100% Arabica beans from a blend of Central America and African highlands. Medium roast.2. Qualit\u00e0 Rossa - 70% Brasilian arabica and 30% African robusta. Medium roast.3. Gran Aroma - 60% arabica and 40% robusta. All Brasilian. Medium roast.4. Gran Crema - 40% South America arabica and 60% Southeast Asia robusta. Dark roast.5. Crema e Aroma - 30% South America arabica and 70% African robusta. Medium roast.Qualit\u00e0 Rossa is the most readily available in Italy and hence the less expensive and most used/sold in Italy also. Qualit\u00e0 Oro is aimed at espresso style, Gran Crema is aimed at cappuccino and latte styles, with Gran Bar and Qualit\u00e0 Rossa being more versatile. Qualit\u00e0 Rossa seems to most to have a balance IN TASTE (smooth vs. strong) between arabica and robusta. The entire Lavazza home line is excellent Italian roast espresso coffee but is best to stick Gran Crema (mixing) and Qualit\u00e0 Oro (straight) for what they're geared for, and in the proper use you will find the correct taste, smoothness, and next to no bitterness, if any at all. They are all superb for use in the right manner and none of them are oily.About me: I definitely do not like bitter or oily coffee (all coffee is oily per se, but I do not like coffee that has a distinct film of oil on top, which you can see at an angle and which is typically bitter coffee). I prefer cappuccinos and \"lattes\", but regardless I like a strong taste and therefore use Gran Crema, but I do enjoy espresso also so I do use Gran Aroma, which still has enough strong taste for my cappuccinos and lattes. My family in Italy in general prefer espressos and use Qualit\u00e0 Oro, but also use Qualit\u00e0 Rossa (much much less). You will only see me at Starbucks in case of dire emergency, which translates to 3 times in 20 years (once after an 18 hour travel marathon in planes). I'm not even mentioning any other coffee places. I use a Gaggia at home and drink tea while I travel. My entire family owns Gaggias. Not because we're married to the brand, but because we have tried plenty others, but Gaggias last us much better than the rest. My mother's must be at least 30 years old. However, one glance at her stove top will convince you it was around before Metusela.Anecdote: I was quite entertained when I learned about the craziness to obsess over tamping pressures, weighing, and stopwatches. Out of curiosity on a British espresso machine that uses no electricity or stove (but you have to have boiling water so you need it anyway), I found a video of this American guy showing the ROK coffee maker which was totally obsessed with this and I learned that it was quite common. I told my mother, who laughed, and shared it at the local bar in her neighborhood the next morning. The barista (our friend) had to call me at 4 a.m. my time (it's ok, mamma has been doing it all these years). He almost didn't believe me. I had to send him youtube links, including the ROK guy. He asked \"Are they crazy? People believe we use scales and stopwatches at the bars?\" About tamping he said it's common sense. It has to be compact enough so that you get the flavor out of the coffee, but not too compact that breaks the pump on the machine."},

We were running beans through the Jura machine and this little object jammed up the grinder. Had to disassemble the machine, and eventually turn it upside down and shake it to clear the ham. Time will tell if it did any permanent damage. It appears to be a little piece of shell or wood. It\u2019s aggravating worrying now that I have to check over 2.2 lbs of beans before I pour them into the machine. This alone is enough to make me shy away from the brand."},

Especially the Super Crema. However, in our most recent bag there was a rock. We found this out during the grinding process in a rather expensive espresso machine. We were able to remove it, but only time will tell if damage was done. I'd recommend inspecting the beans closely before running them through your machine."},
