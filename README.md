# The objective:
- To use TextBlob, VADER, and SentiWordNet to assess the sentiment of coffee reviews by combining these techniques. 
- All three techniques, TextBlob, VADER, and SentiWordNet, are used for sentiment analysis of text data. They are commonly used in natural language processing to analyze the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text, such as a review or a social media post. Each technique takes a slightly different approach to sentiment analysis, but they all aim to identify and measure the polarity of the language used in a piece of text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.
